## filtertoxicity
## This Model Uses An RNN Netowrk To Recognized Toxic And Hateful Texts
## Uses a dataset keggle of texts to train an NLP model that identifies; toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate in the text using TensorFlow.
## Preprocessed the data by removing stopwords and punctuation marks and then used Keras tokenizer to turn words into numbers.
## Designed an RNN model using 4 layers, an embedding layer neural network layers, an LSTM layer, and two dense neural network layers.
